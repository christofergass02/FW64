### TITLE:

Fair World 64: A Text-Based Game of the 1964-1965 World’s Fair

### ABSTRACT:

The project is a text-based game of a typical day during the first season of the 1964 World’s Fair in what is now Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. The 1964-1965 World’s Fair, that Robert Moses presided over as president, was one of the largest and most expensive fairs ever created, but only days after the last fairgoer left through the turnstile most of the many pavilions that brought education, entertainment, and joy to so many people were destroyed to leave a vast open space that is relatively empty to this day. Although most of the pavilions were either relocated or demolished, there are a few structures and traces that live on since the end of the second and last World’s Fair in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Pavilions such as the New York City Pavilion and the Singer Bowl, which are now the Queens Museum and Louis Armstrong Stadium, respectively, are still visited and enjoyed to this day, and renovations to other significant parts from the Fair, such as the towers of the New York State Pavilion and the Pool of Reflections, are further signs of life from the Fair’s half century past.		
  
However, these are only small facets of the World’s Fair that are still a part of the Park. During the 1964-1965 seasons there were more than 150 pavilions and over 51 million people from all over the world came to visit. For most of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, the lack of infrastructure is a significant void from the once heavily populated fairgrounds. Once something is destroyed it is difficult to then piece it together in a meaningful manner, but with the assistance of technology, software and information new approaches can be disseminated for a larger audience to experience, enjoy and gain a better understanding of the 1964-1965 World’s Fair. This significant event of the City’s history deserves another avenue to inform and through a text-based game, a new audience can learn about the Fair and its historical context in as well as allow an older generation to delve into the digital realm.

### HOW TO PLAY
First download the Python file from the repository. Once downloaded the file can then be opened in the command line to be played. if Python 3 is not installed install Python 3. The player types the controls 'left', 'right', 'yes', and 'no' to navigate the avatar through the eastern side of the fairgrounds. There are three ways the player can complete the game: run out of money, run out of time, or reach the Lake Amusement Area or Transportation Area. Once the game has ended the screen will quit back to the command prompt window.


## Python Text-Based Game

The layout of the text-based game has the player control an avatar through the middle section of the right side of the 1964 Official Souvenir Map of the 1964-1965 New York World’s Fair. This section crosses through all five areas of the Fair. Within this section of the map in the game there are 59 pavilions represented, as well as four fountains, one president of the fair, a sculpture, and a light fixture. The avatar begins at the central-east side of the map at the Court of the Five Boroughs in the Industrial Area on the border of the International Area. The avatar then moves through the State and Federal Area to either the Amusement or Transportation Area, depending on the path the avatar follows and the money and time allotted. 


## Excel Spreadsheet

Spreadsheet was created from the combination of information scraped from the Official Souvenir Map New York World's Fair and 1964 Official Guide Book. Contains titles from the map with price of admission, hours of operation, restaurant and snack food descriptions, exhibitions, notes and page reference from guide book.
